    <PackageReleaseNotes>
      * Version 2 is a major refactoring with a better philosophy on how commands are interpreted.
      Method stil become visible as commands when they have the [Command] Attribute, and are in
      a class with the [Module] attribute. But classes now only become command (groups) themselves
      if the [Command] attribute is added to the class as well.
      
      * Descriptions are now added via a separate [Help] attribute, so that Commands can now be 
      generated with custom names [Command("alternate-name")]
      
      * Improved, more specific error handling.
